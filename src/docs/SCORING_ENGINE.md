## SCORING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Mathematical Foundation Principles

**The 240-point base system provides granular precision while maintaining track specificity:**

**Core Philosophy:**
- Context-over-talent approach magnified
- Track bias patterns drive weighting
- Environmental factors quantified
- Human connections prioritized over raw ability
- Situational advantages capture 65% of scoring potential

**Scoring Distribution:**
- Base Score Maximum: 240 points
- Overlay Adjustment Range: ±50 points
- Final Score Cap: 250 points (with overflow noted as confidence)
- Minimum Betting Threshold: 140 points
- Elite Betting Threshold: 180+ points
