# Sample DRF Files

These files are for testing and development only.

- `sample.drf` — Real DRF file used to validate parser
- Source track is incidental — parser must work for ANY track
- Do not hardcode any track-specific logic based on these samples

The parser extracts track code from Field 1 and looks up track intelligence dynamically.
