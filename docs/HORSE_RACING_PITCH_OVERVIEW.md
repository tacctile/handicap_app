# Chapter 1: Introduction - What Problem Are We Solving?

## The Challenge Every Horseplayer Faces

Horse racing is one of the oldest forms of wagering entertainment in the world. Every day, thousands of people study race programs, analyze past performances, and try to pick winners. But here's the truth that most casual bettors don't understand:

**Picking winners isn't the goal. Finding VALUE is.**

Consider this scenario: A horse has a 50% chance of winning a race. If the odds are 1:1 (even money), betting on this horse is a break-even proposition long-term. But if the public has mispriced this horse at 3:1 odds because they don't understand the data as well as you do, you now have an edge.

The problem? Analyzing all the factors that determine a horse's true chances of winning takes expertise, time, and mental bandwidth that most people simply don't have. Professional handicappers spend hours studying:

- Speed figures from past races
- How the pace of today's race might unfold
- Trainer and jockey statistics in specific situations
- Track surface and weather conditions
- Equipment changes and their implications
- Class levels and whether a horse is moving up or down in competition

**Furlong solves this problem by doing the heavy lifting.**

We take the raw data from official racing publications, run it through a sophisticated scoring algorithm, layer on artificial intelligence analysis, and deliver actionable betting suggestions—all focused on one thing: finding horses whose true winning chances are higher than what the betting public believes.

## Our North Star: Value, Not Victory

Let us be clear about something important: **We are not in the business of picking winners.**

We are in the business of finding value.

A horse that wins 10% of the time but pays 15:1 when it wins is more profitable long-term than a horse that wins 35% of the time but only pays 1:1. This counterintuitive truth is what separates recreational bettors from those who treat this as a serious pursuit.

Our tool is engineered specifically to hunt for the diamond in the rough—the overlooked horse that the public has undervalued. While we do provide projected finish positions for each horse (because context matters), that projection is not the source of truth. It's not our North Star.

Our North Star is the EDGE: the difference between what we calculate a horse's true probability to be versus what the betting public thinks it is.

# Chapter 2: Horse Racing 101 - Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into how Furlong works, let's establish a foundation for those new to horse racing.

## The Racetrack Layout

A horse race takes place on a track that can be:

- **Dirt** - The traditional American racing surface
- **Turf** - Grass, common in European-style racing and many American tracks
- **Synthetic** - Man-made all-weather surfaces (like Polytrack or Tapeta)

Races are measured in **furlongs** (one furlong = 1/8 of a mile = 220 yards). Common race distances include:

- **Sprint races**: 5-7 furlongs (fast, favors early speed horses)
- **One-turn mile**: 8 furlongs
- **Route races**: 1 1/16 miles to 1 1/4 miles (stamina becomes crucial)
- **Classic distance**: 1 1/4 miles (the Kentucky Derby distance)

## Race Classifications

Not all races are created equal. They're organized by class levels, from lowest to highest:

**Claiming Races** - The bread and butter of daily racing. Horses are "for sale" at a set price. A $10,000 claiming race features horses valued around that amount. The claiming price tells you the relative quality of horses—a $50,000 claimer is much higher class than a $10,000 claimer.

**Maiden Races** - For horses that have never won a race. "Maiden special weight" races are higher quality than "maiden claiming" races.

**Allowance Races** - Horses compete based on conditions (like "non-winners of two races" or "non-winners of $50,000 lifetime"). Higher quality than claiming.

**Stakes Races** - The highest class. These include:

- Listed stakes (lowest stakes tier)
- Graded stakes (Grade III, Grade II, Grade I)
- Grade I races are the pinnacle (Kentucky Derby, Breeders' Cup races)

Understanding class is critical because a horse dropping from higher class competition to lower class ("class drop") often has hidden advantages.

## Running Styles

Horses have natural tendencies in how they like to run:

**E (Early Speed / Front-Runner)** - These horses break quickly and try to lead from start to finish. They're "on the lead" or "pressing the pace."

**P (Presser)** - These horses sit just behind the leaders, waiting to pounce in the stretch.

**S (Stalker)** - A tactical style, sitting mid-pack and making a move at the right time.

**C (Closer)** - These horses come from behind, making one big late run. They need a fast early pace to tire out the front-runners.

The interaction between running styles in a race is called the **pace scenario**, and it's one of the most important factors in handicapping.

## The Key Players

**Trainer** - The person who conditions and trains the horse. Some trainers excel in specific situations (first-time starters, horses returning from layoffs, grass racing, etc.).

**Jockey** - The rider. Elite jockeys can make a difference, but the horse matters more than most people think.

**Owner** - Pays the bills, makes business decisions about where and when the horse races.

**Breeding** - A horse's genetics (sire = father, dam = mother, dam sire = maternal grandfather) influence their surface and distance preferences.

## Common Terms You'll Encounter

| Term                   | Definition                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Beyer Speed Figure** | A standardized speed rating that allows comparison across tracks            |
| **Morning Line (ML)**  | The track handicapper's estimated odds, set before betting begins           |
| **Post Position (PP)** | Which gate the horse starts from (1 = innermost, rail)                      |
| **Furlong**            | 1/8 mile (220 yards)                                                        |
| **In the Money (ITM)** | Finishing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd                                                  |
| **Overlay**            | When the actual odds are higher than the horse's true probability suggests  |
| **Underlay**           | When the odds are lower than they should be (bad value)                     |
| **Chalk**              | The favorite (lowest odds horse)                                            |
| **Longshot**           | A horse with high odds (low probability of winning)                         |
| **Scratch**            | When a horse is withdrawn from a race                                       |
| **Blinkers**           | Equipment that restricts peripheral vision to help a horse focus            |
| **Lasix**              | A diuretic medication that prevents bleeding during exercise                |
| **Bullet Work**        | The fastest workout of the day at that distance                             |
| **Trip**               | The journey a horse experienced during a race (good trip vs. troubled trip) |

# Chapter 3: The DRF File - Your Racing Bible

## What is a DRF File?

The **Daily Racing Form** (DRF) is the industry standard data provider for horse racing. A DRF file is a structured data file containing everything you need to know about a day's races at a particular track.

Think of it as a spreadsheet with over 1,400 data fields per horse, covering:

- The horse's complete racing history (last 10-12 races)
- Speed figures from each race
- Running positions at each call (start, quarter, half, stretch, finish)
- Trainer and jockey statistics
- Workout history
- Breeding information
- Equipment and medication
- Earnings and lifetime records

This is the raw material that professional handicappers have used for decades. Our application parses these files and transforms 1,400+ fields of dense data into actionable intelligence.

## How Furlong Uses DRF Data

When you upload a DRF file to Furlong:

1. **Parsing**: Our web worker (a background process that doesn't freeze your screen) reads the file and extracts every relevant data point.

2. **Validation**: We check for data quality issues, missing fields, and encoding problems.

3. **Structuring**: The raw data becomes organized race-by-race, horse-by-horse.

4. **Enrichment**: We calculate derived statistics that aren't directly in the file—like wet track records compiled from past performances, or distance aptitude scores.

5. **Scoring**: Each horse receives a comprehensive score (more on this in Chapter 6).

6. **AI Analysis**: Our five specialized AI bots analyze the race for hidden angles.

7. **Presentation**: The processed data appears in an intuitive interface designed for quick decision-making.

The entire process happens in seconds. What used to take professional handicappers hours of manual calculation now happens almost instantly.

# Chapter 4: Understanding Bet Types

Horse racing offers a variety of ways to wager, ranging from simple to complex. Understanding these is crucial because different bet types suit different situations.

## Straight Bets (Single Horse Selection)

**WIN** - Your horse must finish first. Simple, but the odds reflect the consensus opinion of the betting public.

**PLACE** - Your horse must finish first OR second. Lower payouts than Win bets, but you get two chances.

**SHOW** - Your horse must finish first, second, OR third. Even lower payouts, but three chances to cash.

_Strategy Note_: Place and Show bets are often undervalued for longshots. A 20:1 shot that finishes second still pays something meaningful on a Place bet, while a Win bet returns nothing.

## Horizontal Exotics (Single Race, Multiple Horses)

**EXACTA** - Pick the first two finishers in exact order. A $2 Exacta on 3-7 means horse #3 wins and horse #7 finishes second.

**EXACTA BOX** - Pick two or more horses to finish first and second in ANY order. A $2 box on 3-7 costs $4 because you're betting 3-7 AND 7-3.

**EXACTA KEY** - One horse must finish in a specific position with multiple horses in the other position. "3 over 4,5,7" means #3 wins and 4, 5, or 7 finishes second.

**TRIFECTA** - Pick the first three finishers in exact order. Harder to hit, but pays much more.

**TRIFECTA BOX** - Your three horses can finish 1-2-3 in any order. A 3-horse box = 6 combinations.

**SUPERFECTA** - Pick the first FOUR finishers in exact order. Very difficult, but payouts can be substantial.

**QUINELLA** - Pick the first two finishers in either order (similar to exacta box but structured differently at some tracks).

## Vertical Exotics (Multiple Races)

These bets span consecutive races and offer the largest payouts.

**DAILY DOUBLE** - Pick the winners of two consecutive races.

**PICK 3** - Pick winners of three consecutive races.

**PICK 4** - Pick winners of four consecutive races.

**PICK 5** - Pick winners of five consecutive races.

**PICK 6** - Pick winners of six consecutive races. Often features jackpot carryovers worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## What Furlong Focuses On

Our betting suggestions emphasize:

1. **Win bets on value horses** - Where our calculated edge is highest
2. **Place bets on longshots** - Where the math often favors the bettor
3. **Exacta structures** - Boxing top contenders or keying our value pick
4. **Trifecta wheels** - Using a value horse in the key position
5. **Multi-race sequences** - Pick 3, Pick 4 for users who want larger potential returns

We specifically identify three tiers of horses:

- **Tier 1 (Contenders)**: The obvious players—safe to use
- **Tier 2 (Logical Alternatives)**: Good horses offering value
- **Tier 3 (Value Bombs)**: The diamonds in the rough—longshots with genuine upset potential

# Chapter 5: The Art of Finding Value

## What is "Value" in Horse Racing?

Value is the gap between a horse's true probability of winning and what the betting public believes that probability to be.

Here's the math made simple:

If a horse's odds are 4:1, the betting public implies a 20% win probability (1 ÷ 5 = 0.20 = 20%).

But if our analysis suggests the horse actually has a 30% chance, we have a 10-percentage-point edge. That's a massive overlay.

**Overlay** = Your model's probability > Market's implied probability

**Underlay** = Your model's probability < Market's implied probability (avoid these!)

## Why the Public Misprices Horses

The betting public consistently makes predictable errors:

**Recency Bias** - A horse that ran poorly last time gets hammered in the odds, even if that race had a legitimate excuse (troubled trip, bad pace scenario, wrong surface).

**Name Recognition** - Famous trainers, popular jockeys, and horses with buzz get over-bet.

**Favorite Bias** - The crowd loves favorites. Research shows favorites are actually slightly over-bet on average.

**Surface/Distance Confusion** - A horse switching from dirt to turf (or vice versa) may be mispriced if bettors don't understand its breeding suggests it will handle the switch.

**Class Misunderstanding** - A horse dropping from tough Grade II stakes to an allowance race might look outclassed on paper but is actually stepping down.

**Trip Trouble Ignorance** - A horse that finished 6th but was blocked, steadied, and never had a clear path is much better than that finish suggests.

## How Furlong Identifies Value

Our system generates an **Overlay Score** ranging from -40 to +40 points on top of the base score. This overlay captures situational micro-edges:

| Factor                 | What We're Looking For                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pace Dynamics          | Will the pace favor this horse's running style?        |
| Trip Trouble History   | Did this horse have excuses in recent races?           |
| Class Movement         | Is this horse dropping in class with hidden quality?   |
| Vulnerable Favorite    | Is the betting favorite beatable today?                |
| Field Spread           | Is this a wide-open race where chaos favors longshots? |
| Connection Hot Streaks | Is the trainer/jockey combination running hot?         |

When multiple factors align for a single horse, that's when we get excited. That's our diamond in the rough.

## The Three-Tier Value System

**Tier 1: Cover Chalk (180-240 points)**
High-quality horses with strong fundamentals. These are your foundation plays—unlikely to offer massive overlays but reliable for exotic structures.

**Tier 2: Logical Alternatives (160-179 points)**
Good horses with tactical advantages or positive form cycles. Often overlooked by the public because a more obvious horse exists. These represent solid value opportunities.

**Tier 3: Value Bombs (130-159 points)**
The true targets. These horses have at least 25% overlay, meaning the public has significantly underestimated them. Requires specific conditions to recommend (we're not just throwing darts).

Our "Diamond in Rough" override forces any horse scoring 140-170 with 150%+ overlay into Tier 2, ensuring we never ignore a horse just because its raw score isn't elite.

# Chapter 6: Our Scoring Philosophy - How We Evaluate Horses

## The 336-Point Foundation

Every horse receives a base score from 0 to 336 points, distributed across multiple categories. The weights reflect what actually predicts race outcomes:

### Score Distribution

| Category         | Points | % of Total | What It Measures                       |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Speed & Class    | 140    | 42.3%      | Raw ability demonstrated in past races |
| Form             | 50     | 15.1%      | Recent performance patterns and trends |
| Pace             | 35     | 10.6%      | How today's race shape fits this horse |
| Connections      | 23     | 6.9%       | Trainer, jockey, and their synergy     |
| Distance/Surface | 20     | 6.0%       | Track and distance preferences         |
| Post Position    | 12     | 3.6%       | Starting gate advantage/disadvantage   |
| Odds Factor      | 12     | 3.6%       | Market wisdom (when useful)            |
| Track Specialist | 10     | 3.0%       | History at today's specific track      |
| Equipment        | 8      | 2.4%       | Gear changes that signal intent        |
| Trainer Patterns | 8      | 2.4%       | Situational trainer statistics         |
| Other Factors    | 13     | 3.9%       | Age, weight, breeding, combos          |

### Speed & Class (140 points) - The Foundation

Speed figures are the single best predictor of race outcomes. We use Beyer Speed Figures (the industry standard) and compare each horse's figures against the "par" for today's race class.

- A horse with figures consistently above par earns high speed points
- A horse with improving figures earns a trend bonus
- Class evaluation considers where the horse has competed and how it fared

_Importantly_: We apply "recency decay" to older figures. A 95 Beyer from last month is worth more than a 95 Beyer from six months ago.

### Form (50 points) - Current Condition

A fast horse that's out of form won't run to its best. We evaluate:

- Recent finish positions (last 3 races weighted 50%, 30%, 20%)
- Days since last race (optimal: 7-35 days; penalized beyond 90 days)
- Win streaks and consistency patterns
- Layoff adjustments (returning from breaks)

### Pace (35 points) - Tactical Fit

This is where our AI really shines (more in Chapter 7). We analyze:

- The likely pace scenario (fast, moderate, slow)
- Whether this horse's running style benefits from that pace
- Lone speed situations (one front-runner with no pressure = dangerous)
- Speed duels (multiple front-runners tire each other out = closers benefit)

### The Overlay Adjustment (±40 points)

The base score is static—it reflects the horse's fundamental quality. The overlay adjustment captures race-day specifics:

- **Positive overlay**: Pace favors this horse, trainer pattern positive, troubled trips masked ability
- **Negative overlay**: Wrong pace scenario, class rise too steep, connections cold

This brings the final score range to 0-376 points (though most horses fall between 100-280).

## What Our Score Tells You

| Score Range | Interpretation                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 220+        | Elite contender, likely short odds        |
| 180-219     | Strong contender, worth considering       |
| 160-179     | Playable alternative, potential value     |
| 140-159     | Upset possibility, need additional angles |
| Below 140   | Long odds, only play with specific reason |

**Remember**: A 160-point horse at 8:1 odds may be a better bet than a 220-point horse at 2:1 odds. The score tells you ability; you must compare it to the odds to find value.

# Chapter 7: The Five-Bot AI System

## Why AI? Why Now?

The scoring algorithm handles the quantitative analysis—speed figures, class pars, running style classification. But racing also has qualitative elements that require interpretation:

- Did this horse have traffic trouble that the numbers don't show?
- Is the favorite vulnerable for reasons the public isn't seeing?
- How will the pace actually unfold given these specific horses?

Our AI layer processes structured prompts through Google's Gemini model, specialized into five distinct analysis "bots." Each bot has a specific job, and their findings are aggregated to surface insights that pure math might miss.

## The Five Bots

### 1. Trip Trouble Detector

**Mission**: Identify horses whose recent poor finishes were caused by trouble, not lack of ability.

This bot scans past performance comments and running lines looking for:

- Blocked in traffic
- Steadied or checked
- Forced wide on turns
- Bumped at start
- Never had a clear path

**Output**: Horses flagged with HIGH confidence (trouble in 2+ recent races) or MEDIUM confidence (single troubled trip). These horses have "masked ability"—they're better than their recent finishes suggest.

### 2. Pace Scenario Analyst

**Mission**: Project how the race will unfold and identify which horses benefit.

Analyzes:

- How many early speed horses are entered
- Whether a speed duel is likely
- If one horse will get a "lone speed" free ride
- Which running styles will benefit from the projected pace

**Output**: Pace classification (DEAD, SLOW, HONEST, MODERATE_HOT, HOT) and which horses gain tactical advantage.

### 3. Vulnerable Favorite Detector

**Mission**: Identify when the betting favorite is beatable.

Looks for:

- Form decline (recent figures trending down)
- Class rise (moving up in competition)
- Pace disadvantage (wrong running style for today's scenario)
- Trainer pattern concerns (poor record in this situation)
- Physical concerns (long layoff, equipment changes)

**Output**: Vulnerability assessment with specific reasons. A vulnerable favorite opens the door for value plays.

### 4. Field Spread Analyzer

**Mission**: Classify the competitive nature of the race.

Race types:

- **DOMINANT**: One clear standout (likely low-value race)
- **SEPARATED**: Two tiers of horses, clear division
- **COMPETITIVE**: Multiple viable contenders
- **WIDE OPEN**: Chaos race where longshots have legitimate chances

**Output**: Field classification and per-horse tier assignments (A, B, C categories).

### 5. Class Drop Analyzer

**Mission**: Identify horses dropping in class who might be undervalued.

_Important note_: This bot is **reinforcement-only**. It cannot create value candidates by itself—it can only strengthen signals from other bots. This prevents false positives from "chronic droppers" who keep losing despite class relief.

Looks for:

- Major drops (40%+ drop in class)
- Moderate drops (25-39%)
- Minor drops (20-24%)
- Rising class (potential overmatched)

**Output**: Class movement classification with signal boost for horses already flagged by other bots.

## Signal Aggregation: How the Bots Work Together

When multiple bots flag the same horse, confidence increases:

| Scenario                                 | Adjustment                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Trip trouble HIGH + Pace advantage       | +3 points, HIGH confidence     |
| Trip trouble + Class drop + Pace neutral | +2 points, MEDIUM confidence   |
| Vulnerable favorite + Pace disadvantage  | Favorite demoted -2 points     |
| Single bot flag only                     | +1 point max, requires caution |

The maximum adjustment is capped at ±3 points to prevent AI from overriding the algorithm's mathematical foundation.

## AI-Generated Outputs

After bot analysis, the system produces:

**Race Narrative**: A 2-3 sentence summary of the race dynamics in plain English.

**Per-Horse Insights**: Key strength and weakness for each horse, one-liner explanations.

**Value Labels**: BEST BET, PRIME VALUE, SOLID PLAY, FAIR PRICE, AVOID, etc.

**Betting Verdict**: Template recommendation (PASS, Template A/B/C) with sizing guidance.

**Ticket Construction**: Suggested exacta/trifecta structures based on analysis.

# Chapter 9: Bankroll Management - Playing the Long Game

## Why Bankroll Management Matters

The best handicapper in the world will go broke without proper bankroll management. Variance is real—even +EV (positive expected value) plays lose sometimes. Bankroll management ensures you survive the inevitable losing streaks to capture long-term profits.

## The Kelly Criterion

Our betting recommendations use the **Kelly Criterion**, a formula developed by mathematician John Kelly that calculates the optimal bet size to maximize long-term growth:

```
Optimal Bet = (Edge / Odds)

Where:
- Edge = Your win probability minus implied probability
- Odds = Decimal odds minus 1
```

**Example**: You believe a horse has a 25% chance to win (your model) at 5:1 odds (implies 16.7% chance).

- Your edge: 25% - 16.7% = 8.3%
- Kelly fraction: 8.3% / 5 = 1.66% of bankroll

A $1,000 bankroll would suggest a $16.60 bet.

## Our Kelly Approach

Full Kelly is mathematically optimal but has high variance. We default to **Quarter Kelly** (25% of the calculated optimal), which:

- Reduces volatility significantly
- Still captures the benefits of proportional betting
- Protects against model uncertainty

### Risk Profiles

| Profile      | Kelly Fraction | Max Bet        | Target User                        |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Conservative | 1/8 Kelly      | 1% of bankroll | Beginners, capital preservation    |
| Balanced     | 1/4 Kelly      | 2% of bankroll | Most users (default)               |
| Aggressive   | 1/2 Kelly      | 5% of bankroll | Experienced, higher risk tolerance |

## Practical Constraints

Beyond Kelly, we enforce:

- **Minimum bets**: Track minimums ($2 typically)
- **Maximum exposure**: Never more than 10% of bankroll at risk simultaneously
- **Bet rounding**: Practical amounts (whole dollars)
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Smaller bankrolls get more conservative limits

## The Psychological Edge

Proper bankroll management isn't just math—it's psychology. When you know each bet is sized appropriately:

- You don't chase losses
- You don't over-bet "sure things"
- You maintain discipline through losing streaks
- You compound wins effectively

This is how casual bettors become serious handicappers.

# Chapter 10: The Technical Foundation

## Architecture Overview

Furlong is a modern web application built with professional-grade infrastructure:

**Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript—a responsive, mobile-first design that works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

**Backend**: Minimal serverless functions handling AI requests and session management.

**Data Processing**: Web Workers parse DRF files in the background without freezing your interface.

**AI Integration**: Google Gemini API powers our five-bot analysis system.

**Storage**: Local browser storage (IndexedDB) for offline capability and session persistence.

## The Scoring Engine

The heart of Furlong is a deterministic scoring engine:

- **33 scoring modules** evaluate different aspects of each horse
- **42 track-specific profiles** with post position bias data, speed adjustments, and par figures
- **1,400+ DRF fields** parsed and processed per horse
- **Reproducible results**: Same inputs always produce same outputs

## Why This Matters

**Speed**: Analysis that used to take hours happens in seconds.

**Consistency**: No emotional bias, no forgetting to check a factor.

**Scalability**: Handle any track, any day, any field size.

**Accessibility**: Professional-grade analysis available to everyone, not just full-time handicappers.

## Security & Privacy

- No racing data stored on servers—everything happens in your browser
- Optional authentication for premium features
- No tracking of your betting activity
- Your DRF files are processed locally and never uploaded
